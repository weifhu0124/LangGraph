{'question': 'How to make a pizza', 'generation': 'To make a pizza, pour 160 ml of water into a bowl, add yeast, and mix with 250g of white bread flour. Shape and bake the pizza dough at 500°F on a preheated stone until just cooked through. Use a pizza peel or baking sheet to transfer the pizza dough and parchment paper onto your pizza stone, pan, or baking sheet.', 'documents': [Document(metadata={}, page_content='Pour 160 ml of water into a bowl. Add a sachet of yeast. Get 250g of white bread flour, or just plain white flour. Mix the flour with the water.\nAs the pizza bakes and the dough puffs and rises in the oven, the toppings will naturally flow toward the center of the pie, so go easy on toppings in the middle. If baking in a kitchen oven, brush edges of dough lightly with 1 teaspoon **extra-virgin olive oil** or **Smashed Garlic Oil**, being careful not to get oil on the pizza peel. (If baking in an indoor pizza oven, skip this step.) Drizzle dough evenly with another 1 teaspoon **extra-virgin olive oil** or **Smashed Garlic Oil,** leaving a 1-inch border. Shape and bake pizza dough at 500°F on preheated stone until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Bake pizza dough according to "Baking in a Backyard Pizza Oven" (see above) until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes, rotating pizza every 30 seconds.\nIf you have a pizza stone, make sure it’s inside the preheating oven. Use your pizza peel or a flat baking sheet to transfer the pizza dough *and* the parchment paper onto your pizza stone, pizza pan, or baking sheet. * NOTE: The ingredient list has the amount of toppings you need to make **one 12-inch pizza.** If you followed my pizza dough recipe, you will have 2 balls of dough. This layer of oil helps provide a barrier between the toppings and the dough, helping it cook more evenly.If you love a thicker crust pizza, let the rolled-out dough **rest for 10 minutes.** You can skip this rest no problem. 8. Thank you for this pizza dough recipe and how to make the pizza recipe.')]}
